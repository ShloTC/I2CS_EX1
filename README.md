# I2CS_EX1
Second assignment in Intro to CS (java) - Ariel University
This assignment works based on arrays representing polynoms, with each array index representing the exponent of x. e.g: [x^0, x^1, x^2, ...]
for example, the polynom x^2 + 2x + 3 will be saved as the array [3, 2, 1]
the functions implemented in this assignment include: polynomfrompoints, poly, add, mul, derivative, and more.
result after implementation of all functions:

this shows the function: 0.02x^4-0.02x^3-0.7x^2+1x+2, and it's derivative, calculating the area between them.
Please note that the code is within branch "master" and not "main" (apologies for confusion, i had some technical issues)
